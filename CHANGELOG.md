# CHANGELOG

## 0.6.2

- Bugfix: Call field serialize method before value serialize method
  so that fields may override behavior of the values they contain.

## 0.6.1

- Bugfix: `ArrayField` shouldn't error on init when not required or
  with invalid value.

## 0.6.0

- Breaking change: When `ArrayField` declared with a Schema type as
  optional array type, coerce incoming dicts into that schema, just
  as we do with Subschema fields.

- Breaking change: in serialization, we are moving the default value of
  implicit_nulls from True to False. We judge that the more explicit
  behavior is the more general case, and implicit_nulls is the
  special case.

- Bugfix: `All` transformation works correctly with arbitrarily nested
  Schema/GenericSchema, including those inside lists or ArrayField.

- Bugfix: DateToIsoString won't error when value is None and field is not
  required.

## 0.5.1

- Bugfix: `All` transformation works correctly with `GenericSchema`

## 0.5.0

- Bugfix: nullish data should not be dropped in transformations (All
  and ManySubmap transformations had this behavior); rather it is
  retained and a decision about whether to present it may be made upon
  serialization via `implicit_nulls` parameter.

- Breaking change: the `All` transformation on a Schema will return a
  Schema. Previously it would have returned a dict in this
  scenario. Similarly, `ManySubmap` will return a list of Schema where
  before it would have returned a list of dict. In both cases the
  post-serialization form will look the same, but nota bene if your
  code manipulates the return value of Mapping.apply() or otherwise
  uses these objects without serialization.

## 0.4.1

- Bugfix: state was incorrectly being stored on schema class rather
  than instances

## 0.1.3
